# Git(hub) Workflow

This document is based on a guide written by @goto-bus-stop and on the Github Forking Guide

This document is both a quick introduction to some command-line Git & a
description of how we'll use Git and Github for this project specifically.

It's quite strict, and in reality we'll be a bit more loose. This just describes
a "best-case" scenario.

## Making Changes

Before you make _any_ change, branch off `master`. Try _not_ to branch off other
branches, because they might get rebased or rewritten, and if that happens your
branch will get super difficult to merge.

To branch off master:

```bash
git checkout master
git checkout -b my-epic-feature # "-b" creates a new branch
```

Then commit your changes on the `my-epic-feature-branch`. Try to keep commits
_small_ and _UNIXy_. Essentially, don't commit a bunch of stuff that does a
lot of different things, but make multiple small commits that do simple, small
things.

```bash
# "-p" allows you to review the changes while adding them, and it also allows
# you to commit only some parts of a file.
git add -p changed/file.java
# "-m" allows you to set a commit message quickly.
git commit -m "Fix rendering of corner board squares"
# If you need more than say, 70 or 80 characters to explain your commit, leave
# off the "-m", and Git will open an editor for your commit message.
# Describe your commit briefly on the first line, in 70-80 characters max, and
# add a more elaborate explanation after two newlines.
git commit
# Example message:
# > Improve Reversi board scoring algorithm
# >
# > Previously, corner squares were scored at the same value as centre squares.
# > However, corners are very useful, so they deserve a higher score!
```

Before committing, it's a good idea to test your code. In Your Favourite IDEâ„¢,
there's probably a button for it! Otherwise:

```bash
make test
```

When you're mostly done with your branch, push it to Github using:

```bash
git push origin my-epic-feature # of course, insert your own branch name
```

Then, open your branch in Github and press the green Pull Request button. This
will allow other project members to review your code. They'll merge it when
they're done.

Also, Travis-CI will run the tests once again, and will prevent other project
members from merging the request if the tests do not pass.

## Rebasing

If other branches have been merged to master while you were working on your
branch, you might need to rebase your branch.

```bash
git rebase master my-epic-feature # insert your own branch name
```

You might run into merge conflicts here. If you're not sure what to do at that
point, poke [@IcyPalm](https://github.com/IcyPalm) or [@goto-bus-stop](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop),
because resolving conflicts is much easier to explain IRL. Or you can ask
[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=resolving+merge+conflicts) if you like.

After a rebase, your commit history will be rewritten. That means that you can't
push your branch to Github as you're used to. Instead, you have to force-push
it, _overwriting_ the commit history on Github.

**ONLY EVER DO THIS FOR YOUR OWN BRANCHES.** Every time someone force-pushes
to master, a kitten dies. Don't be mean.

```bash
git push origin -f my-epic-feature
```
